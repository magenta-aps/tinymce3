* Move functionality from editorhtml2xhtml and xhtml2editorhtml into javascript

* Look into using custom_elements configuration option for blockquote stuff
  on KU

* Figure out how styling should be handled - can we make use of the sites' style
  somehow?
  - body_id and body_class configuration options can help here.

* Create our own subset of valid xhtml elements that can be used in the editor?
